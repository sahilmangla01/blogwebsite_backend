Any pedaling you do on that bike, whether it’s a few loops around the block or a century ride, counts as physical activity. But what makes a bike ride an intense or easy workout for you, of course, depends on your fitness level. This type of activity does build strength, particularly in the lower-body muscles like the quadriceps — but it's primarily an aerobic exercise, according to Milwaukee-based Paul Warloski, USA Cycling–certified cycling coach and ACE-certified personal trainer.

Singh said, “It provides stability and strength to the core muscles, which contain your oblique, lower back, and all of the side muscles. This exercise will also help enhance your twisting stability.To perform this move, go down on your fours. Make sure your hands are directly under your shoulders with your back and legs aligned in a straight line. Contract your abs and rotate and pivot towards the right. Press your hands while knocking your feet on the other side. Repeat this with the other leg as well.“Reverse lunges are an excellent way to work your hamstrings, glutes, calves and quads, while providing you with lower body strength,” said Singh. It is a great option for beginners as it is easy to control the backward motion.First, stand shoulder-width apart. Then, inhale and carefully take a big step backwards with your right foot as you bend both knees to 90 degrees, making sure your weight is distributed evenly between both legs. Now, exhale and extend both knees while transferring your weight onto your left foot. At the same time, raise your right foot to bring your knee near your chest.

The dish is typically accompanied by Indian breads such as naan, roti, or puri. Luxurious, rich and flavourful are the words that come to mind when we think of shahi paneer. Velvety smooth gravy, soft cubes of paneer and a tonne of flavour make this dish truly royal. Serve it with some butter naan or rice for a finger-licking, wholesome meal.",

      long_description:"The DASH diet works by limiting not only sodium but also saturated fat — both of which can be detrimental to heart health, says Kimberley Rose-Francis, RDN, CDCES, a dietitian and diabetes educator in Sebring, Florida. A diet that's heavy in salt can drive up blood pressure, which puts unnecessary strain on the heart muscle, Rose-Francis says. Saturated fat, on the other hand, can increase cholesterol levels. “Cholesterol has the potential of blocking or decreasing the flow of blood to the heart,” Rose-Francis says, adding that restricted blood flow can lead to heart attack and stroke.The DASH diet also works by increasing foods that provide fiber, lean protein, and other nutrients thought to help lower blood pressure.right up arrow. People who want to lower their blood pressure should combine the diet with other healthy lifestyle approaches to manage hypertension, such as getting more exercise, losing weight, cutting back on alcohol consumption, and managing stress levels. Quitting smoking and getting plenty of sleep are also recommended and can improve your overall health"
